## My process

### Built with

- React (JSX, JavaScript)
- Sass (Grid, Flexbox, Mobile-first)

### What I learned

I had to use "tel" input instead of "number" because "number" doesn't fire onChange event if the input is wrong

### Continued development

I will learn more Sass features and TypeScript.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools' CSS Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This helped me with CSS Grid because I almost always forget the syntax.
